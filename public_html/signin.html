            <li>
                One player is designated as the guesser.
            </li>
            <li>
                All other players find a somewhat to very obscure Wikipedia article and read a bit about it.
            </li>
            <li>
                An article will be chosen randomly and all players must convince the guesser that it's their article by describing what it's about.
            </li>
            <li>
                If it's not your article, you have to make something up!
            </li>
            <li>
                At least 3 players are required, but you can play with however many you want!
